I am a 4th year undergraduate student at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) majoring in Math of Computation (math & cs). My interests broadly lie in the areas of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, especially **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**. Previously, I worked at [Kuaishou Technology](https://www.kuaishou.com/en) as an algorithm intern. Currently, I am a student researcher at [Machine Intelligence (MINT) group](https://aditya-grover.github.io/group/) where I am fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Aditya Grover](https://aditya-grover.github.io/); and a research intern at [Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA)](https://www.msra.cn/), Machine Learning / Reinforcement Learning team where I am fortunate to be supervised by [Dr. Li Zhao](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/lizo/).

As an undergraduate researcher, I am still working on projects and papers. Feel free to check out my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=en&hl=en&user=SDAr2FEAAAAJ) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/baitingzbt/). My current project is focusing on Meta Reinforcement Learning.
