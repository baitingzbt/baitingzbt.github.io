I am an incoming MSCS student at Stanford University. I completed my undergraduate degree at UCLA majoring in Math of Computation (math & cs) with a minor in Statistics. My research interests are in the areas of **Deep Reinforcement Learning** and **Generative Models**. I am actively looking for potential research opportunities in Fall 2023!

Currently, I am a student researcher at [Machine Intelligence (MINT) group](https://aditya-grover.github.io/group/) where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Aditya Grover](https://aditya-grover.github.io/); and a research intern at [Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA)](https://www.msra.cn/), ML/RL team where I am fortunate to be advised by Dr. Pushi Zhang and [Dr. Li Zhao](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/lizo/). Previously, I interned at Kuaishou Technology as an deep learning engineer where I built search models and managed data pipelines. 

<!-- As an undergraduate researcher, I am still working on projects and papers. Feel free to check out my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=en&hl=en&user=SDAr2FEAAAAJ) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/baitingzbt/). My current project is focusing on Meta Reinforcement Learning. -->
